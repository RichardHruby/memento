# Deeplearning the world around you

**Description**

The idea is to deep learn the world around you and give the user more context on their day-to-day conversations and things they come across. This project is aimed particularly at remembering people's faces with the conversations they had and pulling out conversation points to recall things. it's a seamless face-wearable hardware that lives streams video and audio feedback to the database which is then deeplearned to transcribe, summarize, and organize, hence can be accessed later when the user asks questions from different converations.
