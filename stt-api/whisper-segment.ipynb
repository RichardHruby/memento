But let me start, like, what's your name? I'm Arush. What's yours? I'm Vig, by the way. Nice to meet you. So how do you like the conference? It's pretty cool. It's really big. I'm meeting a lot of really cool people. My favorite animal is the capybara, so I've been finding a lot of capybara lovers around here. It's been nice. Tell me more about capybara. They're just really goofy. Interesting. Is that why you like them? Yeah, yeah. It's... That's very interesting, man. Like, I've never seen someone who's a fan of capybara. It's the first time. Yeah, they're like huge rats, basically. Oh, okay. Interesting. They're really cute, and there's been a trend going on, going around on, like, Instagram and stuff of reels of capybaras doing random stuff. They're like pandas, by the way. That's amazing. It kind of reminds me of how, you know, people use animal names for, like, technology stuff. Like, you know, I don't want to quite say LLM, but, you know, llama is something. Yeah. So, but that's very interesting. I'm a huge fan of dinosaur, and one of the popular things is just, I think they're very cool. I used to be a very much a fan of a velociraptor, which is like, you know, a dinosaur, right? Yeah. What really sparked your interest in velociraptors? Was it Jurassic Park? I could, it's partly the Jurassic Park, but I would say it's more like the way they behave. Something that was very attractive is just like, you know, they're very intelligent. They work as a group, and, you know, they're kind of excited, like, it's kind of like they're not very big, but they're like super genius, right? Yeah. Like the dog, yes, but, all right. I hope you have a good conference, man. Yeah, you too, man. I'll see you around.
